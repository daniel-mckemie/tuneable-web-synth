# Tuneable Web Synthesizer

A tool for users to assign frequency values to individual keys in order to hear melody lines, intervals, and harmonies in customized tuning systems.

Users are to enter frequencies (in Hz) into each respective box indicated to the left (decimal numbers welcome!). Users need not enter numbers into every box, but 15 options are available. Once numbers are entered, click the TUNE IT UP! button below to build your keyboard! Users then click on the corresponding numbered keys to hear the frequencies played back. Any boxes without a number input will simply not play a sound. To input new frequency values, simply refresh the page.

This tool is MIDI compatabile! The numbers next to each box (48, 49, 50, etc.) correspond to MIDI Note CC numbers. Users may plug in their own MIDI keyboards to work with their constructed scales (note: use Chrome for best results with MIDI). More information on MIDI note assignments can be found HERE.

Polyphony is available when using a MIDI keyboard, but not yet with mouse clicks. Additionally, different waveforms are available when using mouse clicks, but the waveform defaults to triangle when using a MIDI keyboard. It is my hope to have this all ironed out in the near future.

This tool is very much in the prototype phase and is meant to be a useful thing for the community. If you have any ideas or suggestions on expansion/improvements, please drop me a line at daniel.mckemie [at] gmail [dot] com!
